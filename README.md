Workbench is a desktop application to help you manage your Comma EON(s) as well as assisting with installing Openpilot.
It also has a goal of providing easier porting of new vehicles.

> It's in its infancy so it doesn't actually fulfill that mission above quite yet but it's getting better by the day.

## Contribute

Regardless of the platform you are working on, you will need to have Yarn installed. If you have never installed Yarn before, you can find out how at: https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install.

1. Install necessary packages:
  * Windows
    - Be sure to run  `yarn global add windows-build-tools` to install `windows-build-tools`.
  * macOS
    - Once you have installed Yarn, you can skip this section!
  * Linux(You can see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions) what your Linux is based on.)
    - RPM-based
        + `GraphicsMagick`
        + `libicns-utils`
        + `xz` (Installed by default on some distributions.)
    - Debian-based
        + `graphicsmagick`
        + `icnsutils`
        + `xz-utils`
2. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository to your own GitHub account and then [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) it to your local device
3. Install the dependencies: `yarn`
4. Build the code and watch for changes: `yarn run dev`
5. Note: You may have to run `yarn run package` once before to get the node-pty binaries in place.
6. Checkout a new branch for your feature... something like `feature/what-is-it` or `bugfix/the-fix-for-something`
7. Push your change up to GitHub and create a Pull Request to merge your new feature / bugfix branch into the master branch.

To make sure that your code works in the finished application, you can generate the binaries like this:

```bash
yarn run package
```

After that, you will see the binary in the `./releases` folder!

#### Known issues that can happen during development

##### Error related to `node-pty-prebuilt`

If after building during development you get an alert dialog related to `node-pty` issues,
make sure its build process is working correctly by running `yarn run package`.

##### Error with `codesign` on macOS when running `yarn run dist`

If you have issues in the `codesign` step when running `yarn run package` on macOS, you can temporarily disable code signing locally by setting
`export CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY=false` for the current terminal session.
